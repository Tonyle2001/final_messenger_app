# final_messenger_app
Project Description: For my portfolio project, I plan to create a messenger based system that allows users to send a message to specific users and this will all be done through the terminal. The first page will show the login page which will prompt the user to login or create a new user. When the user is logged in, they’ll be directed to the main page where they’ll be able to see the different options. They’ll be able to send a message to a specific user, view the chat history between them and a specific user. After viewing these options they’ll be returned back to the main page for anything else they want to do. Finally at the bottom of the main page can logout. Class File Names/Descriptions: Message Class —> Message = user author, string sent, int timeStamp Child class of message: View Class —> View message = user looker, user sender User Class —> User = String username, String Password The Driver class will consist of while loops for the main page option to select the different options. The first paragraph is what I plan to get done by the end of this project. Another feature that I plan to have is a mass text where I can send the same message to multiple users. This will be an additional feature to be put on the main page. It will prompt the user to enter more than one users to send the message to.
